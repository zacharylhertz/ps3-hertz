    "\n",
    "The `subset()` function is one of the most important tools for data analysis. Let's break down exactly how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Structure\n",
    "```r\n",
    "subset(dataset, condition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Parts\n",
    "1. **Function name**: `subset`\n",
    "2. **First argument**: The dataset you want to filter\n",
    "3. **Second argument**: A logical condition that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE for each row\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Logic Behind `subset(dataset, variable == value)`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write something like:\n",
    "```r\n",
    "subset(officerdata, officer_sex == \"female\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. R looks at every row in `officerdata`\n",
    "2. For each row, R checks: \"Is the value in `officer_sex` equal to 'female'?\"\n",
    "3. This creates a TRUE/FALSE answer for every row\n",
    "4. `subset()` keeps only the rows where the answer is TRUE\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes About the `==` Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "- `==` asks \"is this equal to that?\"\n",
    "- `=` is used for assignment (like `x = 5`)\n",
    "- **Always use `==` when checking equality in conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For character variables, you need quotes:\n",
    "```r\n",
    "subset(officerdata, officer_sex == \"female\")  # Correct\n",
    "subset(officerdata, officer_sex == female)    # Error!\n",
